            <li><subscript>1/4</subscript> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>

            <li><subscript>3/4</subscript> cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Gather all your ingredients</li> 
           <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
           <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 <subscript>1/2</subscript> hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
           <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
           <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and <subscript>1/2</subscript> teaspoon salt.</li>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
           <li>To assemble, spread 1 <subscript>1/2</subscript> cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with <subscript>1/2</subscript> of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with <subscript>1/3</subscript> of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 <subscript>1/3</subscript> cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with <subscript>1/4</subscript> cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
           <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
           <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
           <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
